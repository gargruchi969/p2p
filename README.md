# P2P File sharing app over Intranet
This application creates a network over which various systems could connect with each other. 
It's similar in idea to the Gnutella and other P2P file sharing systems. But this application can be modded to enable systems 
to connect that are on the same network only. 

# Use case
A college campus can have 5k students on an average. Now most of them, like 80%, have their laptops. So nearly 4k laptops 
on the campus connected over the same WiFi. So this application provides a way for these systems to connect with each other. 

Imagine a student, wants to download a movie, watch some tutorial, find some pdf or share last night parties' photos. 
Normally he would google or download a torrent or put the pictures on Google drive. 
But this application, leverages the idea, that there's a great probability, content this student is looking for is already
present on some laptop in the campus. With this app, this person can download that content with as simple search system as 
Google search. That's why a P2P file sharing system. 

# Features :-
* Download speeds are much higher compared to internet connections.
* Advanced Searching for content with Lucene Indexes
* Streaming videos directly without the need for downloading. (Need to install MPC for that)
* Swarming (downloading of a file parallely from various nodes/sources)
* Downloading of complete directories.
* Pause/Resume of downloads
* A great UI interface
* An anonymous system, so no limits on the kind of content that can be shared / downloaded. ;)
* An integrated chat system to communicate any updates
